- A randomized experiment with two samples (control vs experiment) aka two sample test
- Binomial distribution:two independent outcomes (success vs failure)
  - confidence interval p_hat = z*SE 
  - Hypothesis testing
    - null hypothesis (no difference) vs alternative hypothesis (there is a difference)
    - one tailed test vs two tailed test
      - use two tailed test when you are unsure of the direction of the difference; otherwise use one tailed test
    - statistical significance (p<0.05) doesn't mean clinical significance
- Steps:
  1. Define a problem
  2. Define a metric
  3. Design (How many samples do we need-power analysis)
